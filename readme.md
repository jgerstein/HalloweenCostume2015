# 2015 Halloween Costume - Night Sky

[FastLED library](https://github.com/FastLED) keeps me from going insane

I'm using Adafruit's NeoPixel strip, cut into individual segments. Next time I'm saving my sanity and paying the extra for the sewable ones

Note to self: When NeoPixels aren't working, make sure signal is going to data in, not data out
